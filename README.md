# CKD-Multimodal-Deepfake-Detection-with-Contrastive-Knowledge-Distillation

Advancements in computer vision and deep learning have led to difficulty in distinguishing generated Deepfake media. Existing unimodal Deepfake detection methods do not consider the multimodal information contained in the video. On the other hand, existing multimodal-based detection methods ignore the gaps between different modalities. In this paper, to better explore intra-and cross-modal forgery clues and enhance the Deepfake detection performance, a novel multimodal-based detection method utilizing contrastive knowledge distillation (CKD) is proposed. Firstly, considering the transfer learning capability of knowledge distillation, audio and frame teacher networks are utilized to supplement video student network for mining intra-modal clues. Secondly, the teacher information is mapped into the student space and combined with the student video information, then multi-modal information is contrastive to reduce cross-modal gaps, thereby effectively capturing the cross-modal inconsistency. Finally, a noise-based feature augmentation module is proposed to further improve the detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art detection methods.
